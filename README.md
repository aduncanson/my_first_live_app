This is my first attempt at building a python app with django.

The webpage uses a postgresql database and is hosted on Heroku, accessible:
https://src-demo-1.herokuapp.com/login/

admin user - admin/admin

All agent users (usernames: Test1-10) have the password: Happy123+

As of writing this, only admin and Test1 are active users.

When creating new users via registration screen, new users are created in a state of inactive and must be activated in the admin interface.
